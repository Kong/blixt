# Blixt

An experimental [layer 4][osi] load-balancer for [Kubernetes][k8s] with a
control-plane built on [Gateway API][gwapi] in [Golang][go] with
[Operator SDK][osdk]/[Controller Runtime][crn], and an [eBPF][ebpf]-based
data-plane built in [Rust][rust] using [Aya][aya].

> **Note**: The word "blixt" means "lightning" in Swedish.

## Current Status

This is presently a work-in-progress. The project goals are currently:

- [ ] support [Gateway][gw]/[GatewayClass][gwc]
- [ ] support [UDPRoute][udproute]
- [ ] support [TCPRoute][tcproute]
- [ ] use this as a basis for adding/improving [Gateway API Conformance Tests][gwcnf]
- [ ] plug this into [Gateway API][gwapi] CI to run conformance tests on PRs

After these goals are achieved, further goals will be decided.

> **Note**: [TLSRoute][tlsroute] support may be on the table, but we're looking
> for someone from the community to champion this.

> **Note**: The initial proof of concept was written as an XDP program, but
> with more features (including access to ip conntrack in newer kernels)
> available in TC, the maintainers are most likely going to be converting
> this to a TC program soon.

> **Note**: There is an open question as to whether the data-plane should be
> implemented standalone behind the `Gateway` resources, or if it might make
> any sense or be advantageous to implement it as a backend for [KPNG][kpng].
> This is something the maintainers intend to determine before a `v1` release.
